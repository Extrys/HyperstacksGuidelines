# Hyperstacks Guidelines
Hello! Welcome to Hyperstacks Guidelines!  
Hyperstacks is a Creative game where players create their own levels for other players!  
Here you can learn how to make good levels enjoyable for other players!

Hyperstacks gives you complete freedom when creating levels.
People create cool levels which are really AWESOME,
But there are also boring, skippable or impossible levels
Is for that we will create a Filtering system which consists in selecting high quality maps manually!

So in the level selector you will see (in the next updates)
a new tab for hidding the not high quality maps showing only the "**good maps**"
So to make it easy to get your level in the "good maps"
we have designed some guidelines to make your level enjoyable at the max

**THESE GHIDELINES ARE A WIP RIGHT NOW**

Links being bent and not being straight lines

The clever use of game mechanics

Well placed items, make the level not easy to skip

Well placed neons and some spaced ones to force use of the flinging mechanic

The combat is spaced out and the enemies are well placed each round

Usage of complex systems with using repeaters would also be a plus

And last but certainly not least, fun factor!

Good luck!
